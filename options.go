	// the input RC repo directory (where <lang> is the manifest's language identifier).
	// If neither is found, no payload is created and TSV files are copied as-is.
	PayloadPath string

	// USFMPath is the path to a directory containing USFM files for localized
	// Bible book names. This is used by TSV handlers (TN, TQ, TWL) to extract
	// \toc1, \toc2, \toc3 markers for book names in the target language.
	//
	// For Bible/USFM handlers, the USFM files in the input RC repo are used
	// directly, so this option is not needed.

	// If empty, TSV handlers will use project titles from the manifest,
	// falling back to English names from the books package.
